
# PBJ Nurse Staffing Analysis — Q1 2025  

## 🏢 Developed by Veritas Data Services  
Transforming Data into Clarity, Strategy, and Measurable Growth.  

---

## 📁 Dataset Information  
This project uses the **CMS Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ)** dataset for **Quarter 1 of 2025**, covering over **1.3 million daily staffing records** across U.S. nursing facilities.  

Due to GitHub’s upload limits, a reduced sample dataset (`pbj_sample.csv`) is stored in one of the files.  
This version maintains the same schema and representative distribution as the full dataset, ensuring reproducibility for learning and analysis.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective  
The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns in **nursing facility staffing efficiency, role mix, operational consistency, and data integrity** across more than 14,000 U.S. facilities.  
We focused on the core performance metric — **Hours Per Resident Day (HPRD)** — to understand how staffing hours vary by state, facility size, and time.

## 📘 Insights Overview  
- **Average Staffing:** 3.68 HPRD nationally, with median 3.55.  
- **Staffing Mix:** CNAs deliver 63% of total care hours.  
- **State Variation:** Alaska leads at 6.74 HPRD; Missouri ranks lowest at 2.72.  
- **Outliers:** 4% of facilities show high staffing hours, <1% show low.  
- **Weekends:** Average staffing dips to 3.25 HPRD from weekday average of 3.86.  
- **Data Integrity:** Facilities missing Provider IDs show weaker consistency.  

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways  
- Nursing efficiency remains stable but regionally uneven.  
- Smaller facilities tend to deliver more personalized care hours.  
- Weekend coverage remains an area for operational improvement.  
- Consistent data reporting (Provider IDs) is critical for policy accuracy.
